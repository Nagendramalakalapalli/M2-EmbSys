# **SMART WATCH**

## Introduction
Smart watches present a unique set of challenges when it comes to design. They offer a feature-set that goes far beyond what is found in traditional watches but come with expectations of a similar form factor.The features offered by the latest smart watches include application and notification syncing with a smartphone, fitness and health monitoring, location service, voice commands and wireless charging.

## Components Description
  
   - Microcontroller
     An integrated circuit that contains a microprocessor along with memory and associated circuits and those controls some or all the functions of an electronic device (such as a home appliance) or system.

   -  Bluetooth
    Bluetooth is an open wireless technology standard for transmitting fixed and mobile electronic device data over short distances.

   - RFID Reader
    An RFID reader is a radio frequency device that emits a signal through an antenna. This signal is received by RFID tags that respond to interrogation by the reader. Responses are read by the reader, and through a variety of protocols the reader can communicate with all the RFID tags in its field.

    - DAC
    Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) is a device for converting Digital signals into corresponding Analog signals.

    - ADC
    Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) is a device for converting Analog signals into corresponding Digital signals.

    - Vibration motor
    Vibration motor is a coreless DC motor, and the size of this motor is compact. The main purpose of this motor is to alert the user from receiving the call by without sound/vibrating. These motors are applicable for different applications like pagers, handsets, cell phones, etc.

    - LCD
    LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) is a type of flat panel display which uses liquid crystals in its primary form of operation. LEDs have a large and varying set of use cases for consumers and businesses, as they can be commonly found in smartphones, televisions, computer monitors and instrument panels.

   - Real Time Clock
   A real-time clock (RTC) is a battery-powered clock that is included in a microchip in a computer motherboard.
